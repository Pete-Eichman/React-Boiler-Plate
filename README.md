# Getting it set up

First clone down the repository by running the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/Pete-Eichman/React-Boiler-Plate.git`

Then, navigate to the directory in your command line and run the following commands:

```sh
$ npm install
$ webpack-dev-server
```

If you see an error like:

```sh
zsh: command not found: webpack-dev-server
```

You will need to first install `webpack-dev-server` by running the following command:

`npm install webpack-dev-server -g`
